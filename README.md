## DAG View: Role â†’ Cadence

```
   Random
      \
  Weekly  â†’  Daily  â†’  Yearly
      /       ^
 Quarterly â€”â€”â€”â”˜
```

* **Random** (CFO) injects infrequent but vital updates
* Moves into **Weekly** (CTO) for structured visibility
* Then into **Daily** (COO) for execution and compliance
* Topped off by **Yearly** (CHRO) for long-range organizational health
* **Strategic** (CEO, Quarterly) cuts across all with highâ€‘level coordinating role

---

## Why This Matters

* **Clarity & Alignment**: Everyone understands their timeline and dependencies.
* **No Fog**: No overlap, no confusionâ€”each role owns their timeframe.
* **Coordination via Strategy**: CEO connects ad hoc â†’ weekly â†’ daily â†’ yearly.

### âœ… Ready for Discussion

1. **Do you agree with the timeframes listed?**
2. **Any immediate blockers or missing milestoned?**
3. **How do we track dependencies across cadences?**
